    Here’s a surprise … there is in fact a little bit of additional browser formatting for the
<figure> HTML5 semantic element. Also notice that we are not wrapping the share
    icon images in a <figure> element. As discussed in the text, the <figure> element
            should be used only for images (or other content) that is essential but whose position
            on the page could change. The share icons are not really essential so they are not
            contained within a <figure>.
